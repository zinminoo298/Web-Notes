# Making a multilingual Website

## Glob

No other external module is required except for **glob**, which is a library to match files using the patterns the shell uses, such as stars and stuff.

FYI, this module is extremely useful as it helps to load all the language files dynamically. It saves you the trouble of having to load a language file manually when you add a new language. Run the following command in the terminal:

    npm install glob
